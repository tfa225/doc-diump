            <ol>
                <li>Given the amount of money Dennis Barton was requesting to achieve his plan.</li>
                <li>The small amount of work he has contributed to the hearing April 7 hearing.</li>
                <li>The large amount of work Nora Breen's lawyer has performed before the April 7 hearing.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>It's reasonable to conclude that Dennis Barton is paying Dr. Nora Breen's legal expenses with her disabled patient's money to create false criminal charges against her patient's son.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I attended Local Court because Nora Breen submitted an AVO application against me. It was a confusing situation because it wasn't a criminal matter listed for prosecution</li>
                        <li>A solicitor addressed the court wishing to speak to me, introducing herself as a duty solicitor (legal aid)</li>
                        <li>Outside, she tried to pressure me to plead guilty to Nora Breen's AVO request</li>
                        <li>I refused, explaining on principle I wouldn't plead guilty to something I did not commit</li>
                        <li>In the hearing room, this same woman announced to the member that she was Nora Breen's attorney</li>
                        <li>We returned to the court and the separate hearing was created in another room for Nora Breen's AVO request</li>
                        <li>The magistrate asked both parties to explain their positions; Breen claimed she and the "entire university campus felt terrified"</li>
                        <li>I argued there was never any threat of violence and this court action was completely unnecessary</li>
                        <li>The magistrate granted an interim AVO to Nora Breen requiring her to present evidence on March 12, 2025</li>
                        <li>Frustrated after wasting half a day in court, I emailed Macquarie University Health to inform them they were never in any physical danger</li>
                        <li>Note: Nora Breen was NOT included in this email, which would have breached the interim AVO issued the same day</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I discovered an email from February 6th by Dennis Barton (who claims to legally represent my mother - Nora Breen's patient)</li>
                        <li>The email outlined Barton's plan to force me to withdraw my NCAT application or "deter me from making any further application"</li>
                        <li>Barton also proposed having NCAT declare me "not a fit person"</li>
                        <li>The email included a massive $25,000 fee agreement with vague service descriptions costing $600+ per hour</li>
                        <li>I immediately warned NCAT of Barton's intentions to taint third NCAT hearing scheduled for April 7, 2025 and requested a case manager to protect its integrity</li>
                        <li>Four days later, on February 17th, Officer Jack Maguire of Surry Hills police created a document stating I breached Nora Breen's December 2024 interim AVO</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Not having received any criminal paperwork, I sought advice from Legal Aid who directed me to my assigned court</li>
                        <li>Upon arrival, I was identified and the police served with papers claiming I had breached Breen's interim AVO created in December 2019!</li>
                        <li>Nora Breen's lawyer (the same one from December) was present with the police appeared and argued Nora Breen's interim AVO should be granted because of Jack Maguire's accusations</li>
                        <li>I became frustrated as I wanted to challenge Jack Maguire's absurd accusations here and now</li>
                        <li>The magistrate refused, stating I needed 14 days to prepare against Constable Maguire's "new" allegations, which were actually created back on February 17th</li>
                        <li>The magistrate ordered a hearing for March 28th to respond to Jack Maguire's allegations against me</li>

                        <li>I attended court as scheduled and again Nora Breen's lawyer was present with the police and prosecution</li>
                        <li>Just as proceedings were about to start, she hyperventilated, causing the court to go into recess</li>
                        <li>When we returned, Nora Breen's lawyer stated the police were now going to prosecute the interim AVO Nora Breen created in December 2024</li>
                        <li>Because of this, the magistrate ruled the hearing was to be deferred until April 2</li>
                        <li>I became very frustrated and protested as I had come prepared to defend myself against Jack Maguire's allegations presented to me two weeks prior</li>
                        <li>The magistrate ordered a duty solicitor (what Nora Breen's lawyer claimed to be back in December 2024) into the court to educate me about the process</li>
                        <li>In the duty solicitor's office, I inquired why this process had been so chaotic; he looked into the court systems and printed out the multiple criminal accusations being created against me</li>

                        <li>Instead, I was told they needed to set a magistrate and hearing date</li>
                        <li>I became upset because I thought this matter would finally conclude this matter which I've been dragged into court a total of 4 times since 19 December 2024</li>
                        <li>Despite my objections, the matter was deferred to be heard December 12, 2025, close to a year anniversary of Nora Breen's December 2024 interim AVO</li>
